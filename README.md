ReadMe Sections

Description

Instructions

Here, give a short description of the project. It can be a couple of sentences where you discuss the point in time during the course that you completed it, the topic of the project and potentially the tech stack.

- This was my final project to bring together most of the skills i'd learnt over the course of my bootcamp.
  I chose to work alone as this enabled this work to be fully my own and to display my understanding of the tech stack involved, it's also nice to be able to debug on your own and build confidence in yourself.
  In brief, my task was to build a full stack app incorporating a Python Flask API using a Flask REST framework to serve my data from a Postgres database.
  My project idea i settled on wasv to build a Recipe Sharing platform where users can browse, search, and share recipes. Users can create profiles, upload recipes with images, categorize recipes by cuisine or meal type, and leave reviews. Implement features like user authentication, image uploading, and search functionality.

Deployment link

  Getting Started/Code Installation

Instructions

Explain how the reader accesses your code. Include a step by step approach.

- Feel ffee to access my code via my GitHub repository:
  Front end - https://github.com/MBroadbent95/project4-frontend
  Back end - https://github.com/MBroadbent95/project4-backend
  Necessary Installations are as follows:
  Front end:
- TailwindCSS
- Axios
- TypeScript
- React

Back end:

- Python version 3.12
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Psycopg2
- Flask-Marshmallow
- Flask-Bcrypt
- Pyjwt
- Pytest
- Flask-Cors
- Gunicorn

I have included snippets of what your package & pipfile's should look like.
![PackageLock](./readme-images/fePackage.png)
![PipFile](./readme-images/bePipfile.png)
You will likely need to have your own Postgres database up and running, and then to seed the data in order to get this working as intended.
Once you have installed all necessary dependencies & Postgres is live, you will need to:
Back end, run seed. Then once seeded, pipenv run flask run.
Front end, npm run dev.
If you have successfully completed my steps, you should have a working preview by this point.

Timeframe & Working Team (Solo/Pair/Group)

Instructions

Share the timeframe given for the project and whether you worked independently, in a pair, or in a group.

If you worked in a pair or group, include the names of the people you collaborated with. As a bonus, you can also provide links to their GitHub repo.

- The timeframe was 12/4 until the afternoon of 23/4, just under 11 days including weekends.
  I worked solo for this project.

Technologies Used:

Back end:
Python
Flask
Node
Axios
Bcrypt
Pyjwt
Pytest
Psycopg2
Marshmallow
Gunicorn

Front end:
HTML
TailwindCSS
Vite
Axios
React
React-dom
React-router-dom
React-scripts
TypeScript

Development tools:
Heroku
Netlify
Google Chrome Dev Tools

Brief
Instructions:

- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end.
- Use a Python Flask API using a Flask REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database.
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React.
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
- Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. ALLOW time for this.
- Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.

Planning:

As with all projects, it's well known that how good your project can be is entirely dependent on how much energy you put into planning in the beginning, it was no different here.
From the outset i drew up a rough wireframe of what i had in mind via Excalidraw, this can be seen below.
![Project 4 WireFrame](https://i.imgur.com/wfs1EOp.png)

I wanted this project to be a smooth and polished experience, whilst we do run the risk of the final product being basic and bland without many impressive features, i felt confident that prioritising a clean mvp was a better display of my knowlege and ability than the alternative.

Build/Code Process

Instructions

The Build/Code Process will be the longest section of your ReadMe and will be most insightful to the engineers that review them. This is where you will discuss the steps you took to code the project.

You want to see your ReadMes as a way to walk the engineers through your approach and problem solving from the start of the project through to the end.

You'll need to include a minimum of 3-4 code snippets, highlighting code you're particularly proud of and these code snippets will have descriptions on what you did, how and why to set the context of the snippet you include. These explanations are important for the engineers, as they will want to understand what you did and the reasoning behind the steps you took.

You don't need to document every single thing you coded, but walk them through the key sections of the project build.

For any group project, you will just focus on your contributions.

Some people will document the build/code process by discussing the key stages they worked on. Others will do a day by day guide. It’s entirely up to you how you structure this, as long as you discuss all the key things above.

Challenges

Instructions

Challenges are great for showing your learning journey and problem solving, and this is a section that many engineers will check out. Every day of your engineering career you’ll encounter challenges, this is part of your growth and development. It’s the challenges you encounter that helps you become a stronger and more competent engineer.

Here you will detail any particular challenges you encountered as you were coding the project.

Questions to answer here:

What technical challenges did you come across?
Why were these challenges?
What problem solving did you do to rectify them?
Team dynamics/ Project management
Tools/Tech you used

Wins

Instructions

The Wins section is your opportunity to highlight the aspects of your project you are most proud of. See this as your chance to showcase these parts of your projects to the engineers reading your ReadMes.

Things you could discuss here:

Interesting problem solving you did
Strong sections of code
Collaboration with other team members
Visual design of the project

Key Learnings/Takeaways

Instructions

This section is one of the other most important parts of your ReadMe from an engineers’ perspective and helps to differentiate each of you from your classmates and team members.

Engineers love to understand what you learn from each project and how it has shaped you as an engineer.

See this as your opportunity to show the engineers how your skills grew during each project sprint.

Things you could discuss here:

What Technologies/Tools do you now feel more confident with? Tell them specifically what you learnt about these.
What engineering processes did you become more comfortable with? Standups? Pair programming? Project management? Tell them what you learnt from these processes?

Bugs

Instructions

If you have any bugs in your project, it’s important that you flag them in your ReadMe. This helps the engineers reviewing your projects to understand that you are aware that there are issues - if you don’t flag these, then they won’t have that visibility that you know these problems are in your code and it can result in them not having a full understanding of your technical knowledge.

In either sentences or bullets, explain what the bugs are.

If you have no bugs, you can leave this section blank.

Future Improvements

Instructions

It’s common to get to the end of your project and have ideas on what you would do if you have more time, as well as how you might improve it.

If you do, you should detail this here. It’s great to give that context on potential future improvements, to share your creative or technical ideas with the engineers reading your ReadMes.

In either sentences or bullets, explain what your future improvements would be.
